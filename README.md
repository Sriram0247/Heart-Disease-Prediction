## Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to classify whether a person is suffering from a heart ailment or not.

### Methods used
* Inferential statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python, Jupyter

## Project Description
* The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository.
* There are no missing values in the dataset, categorical variables are encoded as dummy variables, and numerical variables are standardized before performing classification. 
* This project demonstrates the use of KNN classification, Random Forest Classification, k-fold cross validation techniques to classify whether a patient is suffering from a heart ailment.
* Data visualization techniques used in this project include barplots, heatmap of correlation matrix, and a plot of cross-validation scores for each value of 'k'.
* We find that the KNN classifier outperforms the random forest classifier in terms of model accuracy.
